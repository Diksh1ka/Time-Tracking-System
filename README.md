# Time-tracking-system
The provided Python code implements a comprehensive project management system, offering functionalities 
for creating, displaying, updating, and deleting project and employee records. The system employs random 
ID generation for both employees and projects, promoting uniqueness and security. The 
calculate_billable_hours function calculates the billable hours for employees based on login and logout times, 
with varying rates for regular and extra hours, and updates the employee's salary accordingly. Additionally, 
the system can generate a detailed time summary report for a given project, providing insights into employee 
details and the remaining hours for the project.
